# Raisin Classification using Machine Learning


## Overview
This project implements a classification model for the **Raisin Dataset** using three machine learning algorithms:
- **Decision Tree Classifier** 🌳
- **Logistic Regression** 📈
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** 🤖

The performance of these models is evaluated and compared using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Raisin_Dataset.csv`, which contains features related to raisin classification.


## Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍 (with Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas** 🏆 (for data manipulation)
- **NumPy** 🔢 (for numerical operations)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📊 (for visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** 🤖 (for machine learning models & evaluation metrics)

## Installation & Setup
To run this project, ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the required libraries. You can install dependencies using:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Read the dataset using Pandas.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
   - Standardize the dataset for model compatibility.

2. **Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Train Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and SVM models.
   - Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.

3. **Evaluation & Comparison**
   - Compute accuracy scores.
   - Generate confusion matrices and classification reports.
   - Visualize results for interpretation.


## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook (`project.ipynb`) step by step to execute the entire workflow and compare model performances.

## Results
After training and evaluating the models, results are compared based on accuracy and confusion matrices. These insights help in understanding which classifier works best for the given dataset.
